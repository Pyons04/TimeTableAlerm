# timetable_alert
This is my second original product and developed in Ruby. It is already uploaded in a Heroku server.

This program fetches the information from https://aoyama-portal.aoyama.ac.jp/ by using "mechanize" gem. This gem makes it possible to sign in automatically.
Then, get my tomorrow timetable and related information like cancel or change the classroom, and posted a tweet to my private twitter account(@Alert_Pyons).

If you have something to ask about this program, please feel free to interrupt. :D ⇒broad.basic17＠gmail.com(Change ＠ to @)
